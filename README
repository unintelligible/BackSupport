A quick and dirty library to generate .Net property type checking and validation for a Backbone model.

This works by generating a Javascript base class from a .Net object, including the type definition
and the validation (set via attributes in the System.Data.Annotations namespace). These will be
accessible from the set() method, saving a bit of time doing manual value parsing and validation
in the Backbone model when the type information and validation is already defined in .Net.

It's fairly generic, but currently only supports Backbone models and isn't set up for integration in
a build process (we use a Powershell script to generate the JS files.)

Example usage:

            var _options = new GeneratorOptions();
            var _options.OutputFile = "C:\\temp\\test.js";
            var _generator = new Generator(_options);
            _generator.AddFilter(typeof(MyObject).Assembly, new Regex(typeof(MyOjbect).Namespace));
            _generator.Generate();
